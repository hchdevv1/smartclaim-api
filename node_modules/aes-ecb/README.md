AES-ECB
======


A pure JavaScript implementation of the AES block cipher algorithm and features.

Simple and very secure Cipher for encrypt and decrypt some sensetive string values.


Features
--------

- Pure JavaScript
- key size (must be 128 bits (16 bytes), 192 bits (24 bytes) or 256 bits (32 bytes))
- Supports all key sizes (128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit)
- Supports all common modes of operation ( ECB )
- Added prefix feature 


**Strings and Bytes**

Strings could be used as keys. But UTF-8 allows variable length, multi-byte characters, so a string that is 16 *characters* long may not be 16 *bytes* long.

Also, UTF8 should **NOT** be used to store arbitrary binary data as it is a *string* encoding format, not a *binary* encoding format.


API
===

#### Node.js

To install `aes-ecb` in your node.js project:

```
npm install aes-ecb
```

And to access it from within node, simply add:

```javascript
var aesEcb = require('aes-ecb');
```


KeyString must be 128 bits (16 bytes), 192 bits (24 bytes) or 256 bits (32 bytes) long.


How it works
------------

 keyString -  is some unique secret key that takes part in encryption and decryption process. 

 input     -  is any string that you want to be encrypted and decrypted later.

```javascript 

var keyString = 'KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!';
var input = 'Some secret string that should be encrypted or decrypted !';

var encrypt = aesEcb.encrypt(keyString, input);
var decrypt = aesEcb.decrypt(keyString, input);
```


Example with "Hello world!"
---------------------------

```javascript 
//Encrypt

aesEcb.encrypt('KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!', 'Hello world!')

// result looks like ' C41XiUDI/bEvSwYO1iZvOQ== '

//Decrypt

aesEcb.decrypt('KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!', 'C41XiUDI/bEvSwYO1iZvOQ==')

// result looks like ' Hello world! '

```

Features
--------

aes-ecb.encrypt has required arguments as "keyString" and "input",

and optional as "pref" - prefix & "s" -separator

Example with "Hello world" and prefix with separator

IMPORTANT * when you want to use prefix you should use separator also it's required! 

```javascript 
//shema  aesEcb.encrypt(keyString, input, pref, s);

aesEcb.encrypt('KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!', 'Hello world!', "prefix", " :: ");

//result looks like ' prefix::C41XiUDI/bEvSwYO1iZvOQ=='
```

IMPORTANT * if you had used prefix and separator for encrypt value so for decrypt you should use separator only, or both prefix and separator as separator! 

```javascript 
//shema  aesEcb.decrypt(keyString, input, s);

aesEcb.decrypt('KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!', 'Hello world!', " :: ");

//result looks like ' Hello world! '
```

```javascript 
//shema  aesEcb.decrypt(keyString, input, s);

aesEcb.decrypt('KeyMustBe16ByteOR24ByteOR32Byte!', 'Hello world!', " prefix:: ");

//result looks like ' Hello world! '
```
